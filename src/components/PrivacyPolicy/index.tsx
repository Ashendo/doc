          &nbsp;framework to access and track you through your device&rsquo;s
          advertising identifier (see &nbsp;above &ldquo;IDFA&rdquo;). Tracking
          refers to the act of linking user or device data collected from

          companies&rsquo; apps, websites, or &nbsp;offline properties for
          targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes.
          &nbsp;Tracking also refers to sharing user or device data with data
          brokers. The use of such &nbsp;tracking is subject to your consent and
          therefore may only be exercised by us with such &nbsp;consent. Apple
          allows the ID for Vendors (IDFV) to be used for analytics across apps

          (except for backup copies), including the &nbsp;Tracks that you have
          uploaded and the usage data associated with those Tracks, will be
          &nbsp;deleted and may not be recoverable. We therefore advise you to
          copy or backup all &nbsp;Materials uploaded to your account before
          deletion. Even if you delete your account, it &nbsp;is possible that
          your personal data may still show up in some internet search results
          for &nbsp;a short while afterwards, if the search engine maintains a

          processes are outside of Ashendo&rsquo;s control and &nbsp;therefore
          we cannot be responsible for any personal data that remains cached by
          &nbsp;search engines after that personal data has been removed from
          the Platform. Please &nbsp;note that deleting any Ashendo Apps, or any
          third party apps to which your account is &nbsp;connected, will not
          delete your account. Similarly, if you delete a third party app that
          is &nbsp;connected to your account over our API, this will not
          necessarily delete all personal data &nbsp;about your activity on the

          processing or such processing is required for the establishment,
